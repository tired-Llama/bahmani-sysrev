(6) Follow-up period appropriate to the aim of the study: The follow-up should be sufficiently long to allow the assessment of the main endpoint and possible adverse events
(7) Loss to follow up less than 5%: All patient should be included in the follow up. Otherwise, the proportion lost to follow up should not exceed the proportion experiencing the major endpoint
(8) Prospective calculation of study size: Information of the size of detectable difference of interest with a calculation of 95% confidence interval, according to the expected incidence of the outcome event, and information about the level for statistical significance and estimates of power when comparing outcomes.
(9) An adequate control group: Having a gold standard diagnostic test or therapeutic intervention recognized as the optimal intervention according to the available published data.
(10) Contemporary groups: Control and studied group should be managed during the same time period (no historical controls)
(11) Baseline equivalence of groups: The groups should be similar regarding the criteria other than the studied endpoints. Absence of confounding factors that could bias the interpretation of results.
(12) Adequate statistical analyses: Whether the statistics were in accordance with the type of study with calculation of confidence intervals or relative risk
